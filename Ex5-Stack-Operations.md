# EX.NO : 1(E) Stack Operations
## DATE: 01/03/2025
## AIM:
To write a C function to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion.

## Algorithm
1. 1. Initialize top as -1 and declare stack as a character array. 
2. To push, increment top and assign the character to stack[top]. 
3. To pop, check if top is -1 and return -1 if true. 
4. If not, return stack[top] and decrement top.
  

## Program:
```

```
```c

#include<stdio.h>

char stack[100];
int top = -1;

void push(char x)
{
   top++;
   stack[top] = x;
}

char pop()
{
   if(top == -1)
   {
       printf("Stack Underflow");
   }
   else
   {
       return stack[top--];
   }
   return -1;
}

```
## Output:
![437311737-49cba1a6-9421-47cd-a84e-3118bf29135c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9baf94-3960-4799-a1be-a64788f17e8a)



## Result:
Thus the C program to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion is implemented successfully.
